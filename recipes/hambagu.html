            <li>Sautee onion until soft.</li>
            <li>Put onion aside in bowl and allow to cool.</li>

            <li>Mix ingredients with spatula or spoon.</li>
            <li>Switch to hand mixing and kneading until mixture is sticky and pale.</li>
            <li>Divide mixture into quarters.</li>
            <li>Scoop out one portion and <em>toss from hand to hand</em>. (It gets the air out of the patty so it maintains shape while being cooked!)</li>
            <li>Shape patty into an oval shape and place on a tray.</li>
            <li>Continue process with the rest of the portions.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate patties for 30 minutes so fat solidifies.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in pan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Indent center of patties. (The centers will rise with heat).</li>
            <li>Cook on patties for 3 minutes on both sides.</li>
            <li>Add 3 Tbsp red wine and turn heat to low.</li>
            <li>Cover patties and steam in wine for 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Uncover and poke patties with skewer. If juices run clear, the patties are finished cooking.</li>
            <li>Raise to medium heat and allow wine to burn off.</li>

            <li>Mix well and bring to a simmer over medium heat and allow red wine to evaporate.</li>
            <li>Sauce will thicken enough that you can draw an line across bottom of pan with a spatula or spoon.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and drizzle over steak patties.</li>
